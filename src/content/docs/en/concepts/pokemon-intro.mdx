import { PokemonApp } from "~/xania/PokemonApp";

In this example we assembled some of the core concepts of **Xania**. In the next sections we will learn about each concept separately. Or you could jump immediately to the final [final code](../pokemon-app) if you are confident you can infer how it works from the implementation.

Notice that when you click many times, the UI does not respond for the duration of clicks. This is because **Xania** keeps track of the pending clicks and invalidates it automatically when new click is received. In Rxjs this is achieved using **switchMap** operator, but in **Xania** it is the default behavior.

```jsx
<PokemonApp  />
```

<PokemonApp client:only="xania"  />
