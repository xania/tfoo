import { Counter } from "~/xania/Counter";
import { HelloWorld } from "~/xania/HelloWorld";
import { DoubleCounter } from "~/xania/DoubleCounter";
import { PokemonProfile } from  "~/xania/PokemonProfile";
import { PokemonApp } from "~/xania/PokemonApp";

**Function Components** are the building blocks of a xania application. They not only represent the structure of the DOM, but also contain **commands** and **subscriptions**. In the following examples we will gradually learn about each these concepts.

### Hello world
Let's first start with a static / stateless example

```jsx
function HelloWorld(props: { name }) {
  const { name } = props;
  return (
    <button click={() => log(`hello ${name}!`)}>
      Say hello
    </button>
  );
}
```

<HelloWorld name="Xania" client:only="xania"  />

JSX in **Xania** looks much like **React**: props defines attributes and children (not used in this example), and the `click` event is bound to a callback function which prints a log message to the console.
