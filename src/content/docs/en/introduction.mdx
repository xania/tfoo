**Xania** is (just like react) a javascript view library for building reactive UI with JSX syntax. Unlike React, client components can be async. Also, state can be async too. This greatly simplifies how we write 'React' code.

```jsx
async function HelloWorld(props: { children }) {
  const { name } = await fetchProfile();
  return (
    <button click={() => log(`hello ${name}!`)}>
      Say hello
    </button>
  );
}
```


## Key Features

- 🚀 **Blazingly fast:** The fastest implementation in the JavaScript framework benchmark.
- 🔥 **React interop:** Xania components integrates seemlessly in a react application.
- 😎  **Fine-grained reactivity:** No vdom / re-render of the components. Supports observables (e.g. rxjs ) as input from the outside world to 
listen to changes and pinpoint the DOM that needs to update without recreating the DOM.
- ⏰ **Async everywhere:** First-class support for async components, and all related aspects, e.g. async update commands, async derived state, etc.
